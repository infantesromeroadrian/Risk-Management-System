- **Block-by-Block Development:**
  - Clearly define individual blocks or modules before implementation.
  - Focus entirely on completing and validating one block before starting another.

- **Architecture Visualization:**
  - Simultaneously create clear architectural diagrams showing each block's structure.
  - Explicitly indicate interactions and data flow between blocks.

  ```markdown
  +--------------------------+        +------------------------+
  |       Module A           |------->|       Module B         |
  |--------------------------|        |------------------------|
  | - Core functionality     |        | - Dependent features   |
  | - Data processing        |        | - Receives processed   |
  +--------------------------+        +------------------------+
  ```

- **Relationship Clarity:**
  - Clearly label relationships between modules in the diagrams.
  - Indicate clearly which blocks are affected by changes in other blocks.

- **Impact Management:**
  - When modifying a block, explicitly identify and review all impacted related blocks.
  - Immediately document and visualize changes in relationships.

- **Change Highlighting:**
  - Clearly highlight in special colors the files and related flows touched during each development step.
  - Document these highlights specifically in the `architecture.txt` file.

  ```markdown
  # ✅ DO: Highlight modified components
  [Module A]---(Modified)---[Module B]

  # ❌ DON'T: Ignore highlighting changes
  Module A --> Module B
  ```

- **Error Prevention:**
  - Always cross-check the functionality of related blocks after modifications.
  - Avoid introducing new errors by reviewing the complete set of interconnected blocks.

- **Consistent Documentation:**
  - Update documentation in parallel with development progress.
  - Clearly document block status, relationships, and dependencies.

- **Continuous Validation:**
  - Regularly validate each block's functionality against the diagrammed architecture.
  - Confirm visual diagrams match implemented architecture exactly.

- **Regular Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review, maintain, and update architectural diagrams.
  - Ensure diagrams reflect the current, actual state of the project precisely.
