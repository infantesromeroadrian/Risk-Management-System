- **CSV Logging Structure:**
  - Each code change must be documented with the following Jira-compatible fields:
    - **Issue Key**: Jira issue identifier (optional if creating new)
    - **Summary**: Concise title of the code change
    - **Description**: Detailed explanation of the change
    - **Date**: Date of change (YYYY-MM-DD)
    - **User**: Username or identifier responsible for the change
    - **Time Spent**: Actual time spent implementing the change (e.g., 1h 30m)
    - **Story Points**: Effort estimation using Scrum points
    - **Status**: Jira status (e.g., "Done", "In Progress", "To Do")

- **Example Entry:**

  ```csv
  Issue Key,Summary,Description,Date,User,Time Spent,Story Points,Status
  PROJ-101,Update login validation,"Corrected validation logic to handle empty inputs.",2024-04-17,jdoe,2h,3,Done
  ```

- **Accuracy and Consistency:**
  - Clearly and accurately document every field to reflect the exact nature of the change.
  - Ensure uniform formatting throughout the CSV file to facilitate Jira imports without errors.

- **Immediate Logging:**
  - Document changes in real-time, immediately after the implementation.
  - Regularly review entries for completeness and correctness.

- **Maintenance and Audit:**
  - Regularly audit CSV logs to verify accuracy and compliance.
  - Ensure CSV files remain synchronized with actual Jira project status for accurate reporting.
