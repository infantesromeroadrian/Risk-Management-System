- **Task Logging Structure:**
  - Each task entry must contain:
    - **Date**: YYYY-MM-DD
    - **Description**: Clear and concise explanation of the task
    - **Assigned User**: Username or identifier
    - **Time Spent**: Hours and minutes (e.g., 1h 30m)
    - **Effort Estimate**: Scrum story points or effort estimation

  ```markdown
  - **Date**: 2024-04-17
  - **Description**: Implemented user authentication module
  - **Assigned User**: jdoe
  - **Time Spent**: 2h 45m
  - **Effort Estimate**: 5 points
  ```

- **Consistency and Clarity:**
  - Task descriptions must clearly state the deliverable or action performed
  - Avoid vague or ambiguous language
  
  ```markdown
  # ✅ DO: Explicit description
  - **Description**: Fixed login validation error on user input

  # ❌ DON'T: Ambiguous description
  - **Description**: Worked on login issue
  ```

- **Effort Estimation:**
  - Standardize effort estimation using Fibonacci sequence (e.g., 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)
  - Consistently apply estimation scale across tasks

- **Time Tracking:**
  - Log actual time spent in hours and minutes
  - Update immediately upon task completion to ensure accuracy

- **User Assignment:**
  - Clearly specify the assigned user's username or identifier
  - Confirm user accountability for the task

- **Jira Integration:**
  - Ensure task entries match corresponding Jira issues or stories
  - Include Jira issue ID when applicable for cross-referencing

  ```markdown
  - **Jira Issue ID**: PROJ-123
  ```

- **Task Updates and Revisions:**
  - Update task records promptly upon changes in status, scope, or effort
  - Clearly document reason for any significant updates or adjustments

- **Review and Maintenance:**
  - Regularly review logged tasks for completeness and accuracy
  - Maintain task logs in sync with Jira for reporting and analysis
